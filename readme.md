This is a new version of CSS Creatures, which was originally released in December 2012.

## How it works

This project utilizes the Twitter Search API, showing tweets sent to the account @csscreatures. Tweets are parsed looking for colors and specific keywords, which are then used to build a creature.

## Syntax

### Colors

The color of creatures can be customized by including a 3 or 6 digit hexadecimal color (e.g. `#AAA`, `#3b81ba`) or a recognized CSS color keyword (see below) in your tweet.

## Modifiers

Modifiers are appearances and behaviors to customize a creature. In many cases, more than one can be used at a time. Each modifier has a main keyword, and one or more synonyms that are also recognized.

-   angry (furious, mad, shake, shaking)
-   camouflage (camo, ghillie, hidden, military, soldier, troop)
-   cyclops (one-eye, one-eyed, monster, wazowski)
-   ghost (casper, scary, spooky)
-   hungry (eating, fat, plump, talk, talking)
-   hyper (animated, excited, happy, pumped, super, smiley)
-   jack-o-lantern (halloween, pumpkin)
-   moustache (mustache, hairy)
-   nervous (anxious, scared)
-   rainbow (colorful, colors, tiedye, hippy, hippie)
-   sad (crying, depressed, upset)
-   sleepy (asleep, sleep, sleeping, sleepy, tired, rest, resting, quiet)
-   square (box, boxy, minecraft, robot, robotic)
